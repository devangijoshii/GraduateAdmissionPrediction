# Graduate Admission Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis and prediction of graduate admissions from an Indian perspective. It uses a dataset that includes several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following parameters:
1. `GRE Scores` (out of 340)
2. `TOEFL Scores` (out of 120)
3. `University Rating` (out of 5)
4. `Statement of Purpose` (SOP) Strength (out of 5)
5. `Letter of Recommendation` (LOR) Strength (out of 5)
6. `Undergraduate GPA` (out of 10)
7. `Research Experience` (either 0 or 1)

## Methodology
The project uses these parameters to build a machine learning model that predicts the probability of a student being admitted to a graduate program. The model is trained on a dataset of past students' profiles and their admission outcomes. 

## Usage
This project can be used by prospective students to assess their chances of admission into a graduate program based on their profile. It can also be used by universities and colleges to automate the initial screening of applications.

## Disclaimer
Please note that this is a machine learning model and the predictions are based on the data it was trained on. Therefore, actual results may vary. Always consult with a professional when making important educational decisions.

## Future Work
Future work on this project could include refining the model with more data, incorporating more parameters, and testing other machine learning algorithms for better accuracy.
